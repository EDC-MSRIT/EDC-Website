                       <h3>What is ‘Idea-Rise’?</h3>
                <p>
                    Entrepreneurship and start-ups sound great as buzzwords but without proper thought
                    and focus they are as good as the water mirage on the road. To remove this mirage and
                    create a real oasis of talent, we at EDC RIT bring to you ‘IDEA-RISE’
                </p>
                <p>
                    IDEA-RISE is an entrepreneurship event which encourages students from various
                    departments and backgrounds to pitch in their ideas, identifying a real world problem
                    something as simple as getting food at your doorstep which we can’t imagine in any
                    way besides Zomato or Swiggy now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to provide not only a platform for these students but also expert guidance so
                    that in this sea of noise, we add a strong footing and contribute to a functional startup
                    culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main aim of the IDEA-RISE is to encourage students to identify problems which
                    can be converted into a business opportunity. Apply technology to find solutions to solve
                    this problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The intent of this event is:
                    <ul class="middle">
                        <li>Enable the students to imbibe the spirit of field work and research. Through this
                            camp the students will need to meet the societal entities to get a first-hand
                            understanding of the nature of the work they do.

                                    E.g. To use technology to tackle the problem of garbage
                                    collection and disposal, the student teams will have to interact with
                                    the actual garbage collectors or BBMP employees.
